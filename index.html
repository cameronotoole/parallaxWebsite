            <h1>Belfast, Northern Ireland <em>(Béal Feirste, Tuaisceart Éireann)</em></h1>
            <p> The Belfast Harbour makes up 65% of the trade in Northern Ireland and 25% of the entire island of
                Ireland. Having it reign
                in at the fifth busiest commercial port in the UK. The Belfast Harbour is also the home of the world's
                largest Titanic visitor attractions. Thanks to the 1998 "Good Friday" Belfast Agreement, the inward
                investment led to a period of sustained economic
                growth and to a large-scale redevelopment of the city centre. Significant projects including the Titanic
                Quarter with it's Titanic Belfast visitor attraction, Victoria
                Square, the Cathedral Quarter, Laganside with the Odyssey complex and the landmark Waterfront Hall, and
                the development of the original Short's harbour airfield as George Best Belfast City Airport.

            <h1> Cobh, County Cork, Ireland <em>(Cobh, Contae Corcaigh)</em></h1>
            <p> On the high point of the town stands St. Colman's, the cathedral church of the
                Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne, is one of Ireland's tallest buildings standing at 91.4 metres (300
                ft). Also a fun stop in Cobh, are the Deck Of Cards, a colorful row of houses along the West View. They
                got their name because they resemble a deck of cards stacked up to make the shape of a house. If the
                bottom fell, they'd all come tumbling down!

            <h1>Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland <em>(Ollscoil Maigh Nuad, Co. Chill Dara, Éire)</em></h1>
            <p> In Maynooth, there are two third-level educational
                institutions - St. Patrick's College, founded under King George III to train Ireland's Roman
                Catholic clergy. Maynooth University, which separated from St. Patrick's in 1997, they both share campus
                space and many of their facilities. Two secondary schools, Maynooth Post Primary & Maynooth Community
                College, run from the same premises by the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, and five
                primary schools: A Presentation Sisters girls-only school, a Dublin Archdiocese boys-only school, a
                Dublin Archdiocese Irish-Language school, and Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge Teo, a
                multi-denominational Irish-language
                primary school. In September 2020, an Irish-language secondary school opened in the town as well.

            <h1>County Donegal, Ireland <em>(Contae Dhún na nGall, Éire)</em></h1>
            <p> Located in the northwest corner of Ireland, in terms of size and area it is the fourth largest county in
                all of Ireland. Uniquely, Donegal only shares a small border with one
                other county in the Republic of Ireland - County Leitrim. The majority of its land border (93%) is
                shared
                with three counties of Northern Ireland: County Tyrone, County Derry, and County Fermanagh. Donegal was
                significantly impacted by The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Adding further to the economic and social
                difficulties of the county, although the greater economic and administrative integration with Northern
                Ireland, following the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, has been a benefit to the county.</p>
